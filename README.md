# Steps for Executing the application

To Execute Backend code of the project, please follow these steps:

- To execute the backend part of this application, we need to use the Spring Boot Framework project.
- The Spring Boot Framework is an open-source Java-based framework used for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- The application can be imported into the Spring Tool Suite IDE, which is an Eclipse-based IDE, for execution.
- Once imported, we can run the application using the embedded Tomcat server that comes with the Spring Boot Framework.
- This allows us to deploy and execute the application without the need for an external server.
- We can also use various tools such as Postman to test the application's RESTful web services and ensure that they are functioning as expected.
